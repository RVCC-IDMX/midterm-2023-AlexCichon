          <h2>My Talents and Experience</h2>
          <p>My name is Alex Cichon, and I have a talent for website developing. </p>
          <p>I have much experience as a web page developer with developing webpages, I though however like to take my time when making webpages.</p>
          <p>When I work on code I make sure I dont mess anything up any, with the code when developing the site that way when the company/person that hired me looks at the site they are satified and everything runs smoothly. </p>
          <p>Thats why people say I have true talent and much experience as web page developer. Being honest though being a web developer is not all that, coding is fun and all making sites and developing them in your own way but it can also be stressful with the code decides to not work.  </p>
